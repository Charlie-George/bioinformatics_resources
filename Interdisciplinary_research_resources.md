# Interdisciplinary Career Resources 

This page summarises some helpful resources to help interdisciplinary researchers navigate thier career paths. 
These have been identified, curated and collected in response to the [XNET](www.xnet.bio) project that ran 2022-2024 to assess the career barriers facing 
interdisciplinary researchers (particularly those at the intersection of computation and biology). 

During this project several barriers were identified that face researchers 
  - Lack of suitable mentorship
  - Longer and non-linear career paths that do not fit the traditional academic mould
  - Undefined career routes
  - Challenges of communicating to audiences with different backgrounds
  - Challenges fitting into promotion, funding or publishing critera
  - Feeling like a 'jack of all trades, master of none'

We interviewed and ran workshops with funders, researchers, research professionals, research culture
and equality, diversity and inclusion experts and industry leaders to identify core skills and areas that researchers felt needed development. 
Here is a summary of useful resources that interdisciplinary researchers might find useful to progress thier careers.
