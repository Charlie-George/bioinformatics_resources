# Bioinformatics resources

This repository collects various helpful links, training materials, courses, code snippets and information for all things computational biology...

I have used many of these sites myself to learn or have across them when looking for good teaching materials and have collated them here not only as a useful reminder to  myself but also as helpful resource to those starting out on their journey into bioinformatics, genomics, programming and computational biology.

There is a lot of overlap between sections but links are split into broad sections
