# Bioinformatic datasets and databases

This markdown contains a list of resources for datasets and databases that are useful for computational biology and bioinformatics 


### Enhancer / Regulatory sequences 
- [VISTA Enhancer Browser](https://enhancer.lbl.gov/) - experimentally validated enhancer sequences and thier expression in mouse and human tissues
- [FANTOM5](https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/data/) - Cage data deffining potential enhancer regions in multiple tissues/timepoints

### Single Cell 
- [MOCA - Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas](https://oncoscape.v3.sttrcancer.org/atlas.gs.washington.edu.mouse.rna/landing)
    - 2 million from 61 mouse embryos from E9.5-13.5 -> ID cell types and trajectories and define marker genes and dynamics ofgene expression within cell types and trajectories overtime
- [Cell X Gene](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/) - explore single cell data sets and clusters - tool from CZI

### TF binding and ChIP assays 
- ENCODE
- Factorbook
- [Cistrome.org](http://cistrome.org/) - database of preprocessed ChIPseq data (not sure how updated it is)
  - Also includes tools:
    - Cistrome-GO for enrichment analysis of TF binding sites
    - Data Browser
    - Cistrome Cancer = predicted TF targets abd enhancer profiles in cancer
    - Lisa = predict transcriptional regulators of DE genesets
    - CistromeDB Toolkit = A webserver to help you find what factors regulate your gene of interest, what factors bind in your interval or have a significant binding overlap with your peak set by integrating datasets in CistromeDB
  - [ChIP-Atlas](https://chip-atlas.org/)
    - Peak Browser = Visualizes protein binding on given genomic loci with IGV genome browser
    - Target Genes = Predict target genes bound by given transcription factors
    - Colocalization = predict partner proteins cologalising with given TFs
    - Predict proteins bound to given genomic loci and genes
- [Epigenome Roadmap](https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/resource/Roadmap+Epigenomics) (2015) 
  

### Physiology of Individual Genes
